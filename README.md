## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Doing this challenge has taught me the importance of a proper markup and the power of CSS, alongside media queries, also, in the cause of the challenge, learning to work with an API feels awesome (by API, I meant importing the google fonts "Poppins" from google api and using it in the challenge).

The challenge has also added to my knowledge, in terms of using markdown files and in committing a file to github, basically working with the command line has improved, all thanks to this challenge.

Some code snippets I'm sure proud off, see below:

```css
.@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto+Slab:wght@300;600;900&display=swap');

:root {
  --primary-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --secondary-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --text-color1: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
  --text-color2: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
}
```

### Continued development

I'll love to create or partake in challenges that will involve me making a simple project in both light and dark modes respectively.

### Useful resources

- [Free code camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - This site personally has improved my coding skills from 0 to a reasonable figure, lol, I'll recommend any person new to programming and coding to check free code camp for FREE. Ensure to be kind enough to give a little donation to help them to continue giving out value.
- [Tech Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) - Tech twitter has helped with several links to quality resources, articles, podcasts, videos, etc, that has helped to improve my coding skills and thus helping me complete this challenge.
